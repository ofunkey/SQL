# SQL - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. The first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, the tables are designed to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data to perform:
* Data Modeling
* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis
