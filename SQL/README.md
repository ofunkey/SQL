# SQL - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. The first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, the tables are designed to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data to perform:
Data Modeling
Data Engineering
Data Analysis

### Data Modeling

![data_modeling](https://github.com/ofunkey/SQL/blob/master/SQL/employee_ERD_data_modeling.JPG)

* Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables using a tool at [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

### Data Engineering

* Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis

Tasks:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


## Bonus (Optional)

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

   ```sql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
   connection = engine.connect()
   ```

* Consult [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql) for more information.

* If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) and [https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/](https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/) for more information.

2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

3. You may also include a technical report in markdown format, in which you outline the data engineering steps taken in the homework assignment.
